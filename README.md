#### What is this?

Currently this is just a hacky solution I'm using to automate compressing and thumbnailifying the user photos submitted for my Koanin.com project.

#### What will this be?

Hopefully I want to make this a standalone module that you can require within any express project that will help abstract away the work of creating thumbnails / compressed files and potentially integrate automated uploading to different hosting services like S3.

#### Can I contribute?

Sure, Issues and PRs totally welcome.
